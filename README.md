UK BAME Organ Recipient Rates by Donors

The requirement for this assignment was to create a presentation deck and include a plotly graph.  Rather than a simple submission I chose to do a mini project on organ donation rates within the BAME communities in the UK.

I was keen to know if BAME communities were contributing as many organs as they were receiving.  These figures will have an impact on waiting times, rejection rates and unneccessary deaths due to unavailability.

It is hoped that the results from this study would where required actively encourage these groups to increase their organ donation registration figures.

The presentation deck is available to view at...
